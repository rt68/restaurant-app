## Vision

As a cohesive team, we are dedicated to revamping our client's restaurant website, not just to elevate its aesthetic appeal but to incorporate a suite of essential features that cater to the modern-day restaurant patrons and managers. We understand the critical role of technology in the culinary experience and are committed to crafting a platform that is both intuitive and comprehensive.

## Background

The BAM JR Ramen Time project was initiated by a group of Per Scholas WISE (Women in Software Engineering) fellows, who want to hone in their software engineering skills while making a meaningful contribution to their community. This endeavor was accomplished through a process that closely mirrored agile methodology, emphasizing collaboration among peers and stakeholders.

This approach provided a dynamic and responsive development environment, allowing the team to efficiently address changes and incorporate feedback throughout the project lifecycle. The project not only served as a platform for technical skill enhancement but also fostered a sense of community and teamwork among all the team members, demonstrating the powerful impact of combining learning with practical application in a supportive environment.
